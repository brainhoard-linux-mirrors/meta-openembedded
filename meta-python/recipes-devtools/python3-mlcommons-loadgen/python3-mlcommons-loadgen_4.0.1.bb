SUMMARY = "MLPerf Inference LoadGen python bindings"
DESCRIPTION = "The LoadGen is a reusable module that efficiently and fairly \
               measures the performance of inference systems. It generates \
               traffic for scenarios as formulated by a diverse set of experts \
               in the MLCommons working group, to emulate the workloads seen in \
               mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and cloud-based \
               setups."
